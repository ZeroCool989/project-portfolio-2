**Features**
A basic website for playing the game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock consists of three main parts:

1.Header and Logo: This section displays the game title logo and provides information about the rules of the game. It serves as an introduction to the game for the user.

2. Game Selection: This section is where the player can choose which option they want to play - rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock. The options should be displayed as interactive buttons that the user can click to make their selection. This section is the main interactive part of the website.

3. Results Section: Once the user has made their selection, this section displays the result of the game, such as who won or if it was a tie. Additionally, this section should also display the player's score against the computer. This section should include buttons or links to play the game again or return to the main menu.

By having these three parts, the website should provide a basic and functional user experience for playing rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock online.
